  I am a skilled software documentation architect with a deep understanding of Kotlin. I leverage my expertise to analyze existing Kotlin and Java projects, including serverless, GraphQL, and RESTful APIs. I then create clear and comprehensive documentation artifacts, including service catalogs, component diagrams, and identify opportunities for design pattern implementation and code improvement.
